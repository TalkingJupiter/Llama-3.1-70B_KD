## Llama-3.1-70B_KD-main/kd/kd_relb.py

**Classification:** Code (Python)  
**Size (bytes):** 685  
**Purpose (Official Statement):** Relation-based knowledge distillation components.

**Declared Imports/Modules:** torch, torch.nn.functional

### Inputs
- See usage within code and related runbooks; typical inputs include dataset manifests, cache directories, model references, and SLURM environment variables.

### Outputs
- Logs to `logs/` (stdout/err) and task-specific outputs (e.g., shards JSONL, cache directories, checkpoints, results CSV/JSON).

### Upstream Dependencies
- Python environment (pinned), CUDA/NVML where applicable.
- For data-related scripts: access to Hugging Face datasets (online or local cache).
- For training/eval: model weights (teacher/student), tokenizers, and cache artifacts.

### Downstream Dependencies
- Subsequent pipeline stages rely on the artifacts produced by this file (e.g., training consumes caches/manifests; evaluation consumes checkpoints; parsing consumes evaluation JSONs).

### Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1. Verify environment and data access.
2. Execute with validated parameters (see CLI above if present).
3. Confirm expected outputs exist and are non-empty.
4. Register run metadata (dataset revisions, commit SHA, seed) in audit log.

### Error Handling & Recovery
- Fail-fast on missing inputs. Re-run with same parameters after addressing preconditions. For idempotent steps (e.g., cache building), allow safe re-execution.

### Logging & Observability
- Emit structured status lines to stdout/err; prefer JSON logs where possible. Training/eval should produce periodic progress and final summaries. Telemetry via `monitor.py` where applicable.

### Validation & Quality Assurance
- Cross-check counts (samples, steps), schema (expected keys/columns), and spot-validate a random sample of outputs.
- For KD: confirm loss values are finite and decreasing over warmup; for eval: verify task coverage and metric ranges.

### Security & Compliance Notes
- Do not embed secrets (tokens) in code or outputs. Limit permissions on output directories. Ensure dataset licenses permit use. Retain provenance for reproducibility.

    return torch.cdist(x, x, p=2)

def _angle_matix(x):
    diff = x.unsqueeze(1) - x.unsqueeze(0)

    unit = diff / norms
    return torch.matmul(unit, unit.transpose(-1, -2))

    t = F.normalize(teacher_embs, dim=-1)
    s = F.normalize(student_embs, dim=-1)
    dist_loss = F.mse_loss(_pairwise_dist(s), _pairwise_dist(t))
    angle_loss = F.mse_loss(_angle_matix(s), _angle_matix(t))
    return lambada_dist * dist_loss * lambada_angle * angle_loss
